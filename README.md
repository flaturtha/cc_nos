# README.md

NOTE: (2024-09-30) This is just be a static github page (`master` branch) so I had a generic site to run FB ads to, but no other site functionality. The `medusadev` branch has my 1st attempts at building the full remix/sanity/medusa site.

And the git repo push/pull seems fucked up. Not that it matters!

## next iteration (2024-10-12):

The next iteration of the cc_nos static site is to create a basic template (using v0: https://b_fpbdsrdavwe.v0.build/ and others) then pulling the metadata and content from either a markdown file or json. This will be a simple set up to point FB ads to during click testing. I'll need to add some functionality, either hard code or random popup to ask if they'd like to subscribe to get a higher fidelity ebook version, which I'll source at BookFunnel.
